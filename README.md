## Introduction

Hello and welcome to Azureâ€™s GitHub repository on sustainability! Here you will see some of the current projects that we are working on as well as tutorials on how to get started with sustainability on Azure. If you have any questions, plese feel free to use our [GitHub Issue board](https://github.com/Azure/sustainability/issues). Thank you!

## Getting started with Sustainable software engineering on Azure

-	[The principles of sustainable software engineering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/sustainable-software-engineering-overview/)

-	[Azure Well-Architected Framework for sustainable workloads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/)

## Azure sustainable engineering hackathon

 - Follow the [sustainable engineering hackathon on Azure] : https://azure.github.io/sustainability/


## Current sustainable engineering enablers for Kubernetes / AKS

- [Sustainable software engineering principles for AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-sustainable-software-engineering)

-	[Kubernetes-Carbon-Intensity-Exporter](Azure/kubernetes-carbon-intensity-exporter). - This carbon aware exporter uses the Green Software Foundation SDK to pull WattTime data and load it into a configmap to be used with the carbon aware KEDA operator.

-	[Carbon-Aware-Keda-Operator](Azure/carbon-aware-keda-operator (github.com)) - This is a KEDA operator that reads carbon intensity data from a configmap and scales the maxReplicas accordingly to whether carbon intensity is low or high.
