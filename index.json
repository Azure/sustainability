The end result of this step is to get recommendations on how to strengthen the workload sustainability posture with the following objectives:\nUnderstand workload sustainability risk, Identify ways to reduce workload carbon emissions, Prioritize actions to reduce workload carbon footprint. Azure Well-Architected Sustainability Review The Well-Architected Assessments target a specific Azure workload and share a common delivery approach with focus on critical areas within the specific tenant (cost, reliability, operations, security, sustainability) of the framework. The objective of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Sustainability Assessment is to evaluate an Azure workload deployment across the sustainability pillar.\nA resource or group of resources known as a “workload” or “application” provides one or more clients with end-to-end functionality (humans or systems). Another way to look about workload is as a whole scenario, including the IT infrastructure needed to support any processes, journeys, or business operations. One or more applications, APIs, and databases working together to deliver a specific functionality.\nThe assessment is designed to identify the level of sustainability best practices that have been applied (or not) to the workload. The resulting report will produce output that contains a weighted set of recommendations.\nTo help you examine the workload through the lens of sustainability, navigate to Microsoft Assessmnts.\nTip Spend time with the team on each question and options presented for the question. Do not just read the assessment questions line by line but read them in your own words and extend them with examples, context and background information to understand why a question does matter and what the impact is.\n",

However, the guidelines at the bottom of this page should still be taken into account.\nContoso is a well-known and historical clothing retailer with a historically storng high-street presence. Their stores are constantly crowded, therefore joining a waiting list may be necessary to ensure entry.\nContoso’s corporate and social responsibility (CSR) “3D strategy” defines the following key goals:\nDeeply care about their employees and their partners to build and nurture fruitful collaboration while delivering the best results, Develop best-of-breed leaders to tackle key challenges of today while mitigating the ones of tomorrow, Deploy the most sustainable, securely trusted, and innovative solutions to drive benefits for their company and also across society. Currently, the retailer runs its e-commerce website on Azure where it has invested in and completed an IT modernization project approximately 2 years ago. When attending COP27, Contoso’s CTO met with a Microsoft representative to discuss the potential benefits of increasing Azure usage in alignment with their 3D strategy to help with reducing their carbon footprint and drive adoption of advanced cloud-native services. This would allow a pivot towards other innovative use cases leveraging their pool of data through the adoption of services such as Azure API Management, Azure Kubernetes Services and Azure Cosmos DB.\nAs a result, Contoso now aims to reduce and optimize their carbon footprint on Azure as well as reducing the administrative burden on their teams by leveraging platform-as-a-service or other cloud-native services where possible.\nFor a start and based upon the above, their plan is to improve their e-commerce website sustainability on Azure – that is the scope of this exercise. You work as a Cloud Solutions Architect and must consider each persona’s requirements in this exercise.\nSakura, Chief Information Officer (CIO)\nMinimize costs where possible, particularly when service demand is low.

Be prepared for the review considerations and design recommendations offered by this design approach to result in various design decisions and trade-offs for various circumstances and organizations. Review the design methodologies in accordance with your company priorities and requirements after establishing your requirements.\nEvaluate the design areas using the design principles Your sustainability journey should be based on the sustainability design principles and design areas listed below. Each design area’s decisions will have an impact on the other design areas. To comprehend the implications, impact, and any known trade-offs, go over the concerns and suggestions in each of the following design areas.\nUnderstanding your emissions Tracking and measuring progress are crucial to achieving any sustainability goal. You’ll never be able to determine whether the efforts are worthwhile if you can’t track and measure the impact.\nFor businesses to calculate their overall carbon emissions, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) is the most popular technique. At Microsoft, we segment our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into three scopes, consistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol:\nScope 1: Direct emissions that your activities create. Scope 2: Indirect emissions that result from the production of the electricity or heat you use. Scope 3: Indirect emissions from all other activities you’re engaged in. The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) defined by the Green Software Foundation is specifically for evaluating the rate of software emissions and was created to encourage the eradication of those emissions. The GHG is a more general measurement applicable for all sorts of enterprises.\nWith this understanding, it’s critical to consider not just the application infrastructure and hardware but also the user devices and application scalability, as they can significantly change the environmental footprint. To gain information and transparency needed to understand your carbon footprint and measure and track emissions over time, you should use tools in addition to these scoring systems.\nLearn how to track and report carbon emissions with the Emission Impact Dashboard and Microsoft Sutainability Manager.\nAnother effective method of calculating the carbon emissions of your workloads is to design a proxy solution architecture based on the SCI model discussed above. Cost, performance, infrastructure carbon emissions (if known/available), usage over time (requests, users, API calls, etc.), or any additional measurement that is pertinent to the application can all be used as proxies when creating your carbon score dashboard.\nLearn how to use cost as a proxy solution to measure carbon emissions.\nThe shared responsibility model for sustainability Sustainability is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the customer or partner developing platform-based applications, just as security. Even though the data centers are designed for sustainability, simply because an application is deployed on Azure does not make it sustainable. Unoptimized applications may nevertheless emit more carbon than is necessary.\nSustainability must combine the efforts of the cloud provider and the customers in designing and implementing applications.\n",

You can use PowerPoint or any other tool like Visio, Draw.io, LucidChart or Cacoo.\nAdditionally, you may want to review the following key considerations to strengthen your proposal.\nCarbon intensity Carbon intensity measures how much carbon (CO2e) is emitted per kilowatt-hour (KWh) of electricity consumed. The standard unit of carbon intensity is gCO2eq/kWh, or grams of carbon per kilowatt hour. Carbon intensity varies by location and time. Get familiar with variability of carbon intensity and aim for a flexible design to benefit from these varations. Learn more about variability of carbon intensity.\nThere are multiple providers for electricity carbon intensity that differ from coverage scope and emissions quantification models. They offer APIs for historical emissions, current emissions (now), and forecast emissions (next day or few days). Carbon intensity data is quantified through predictive models and the quantified emissions data get updated regularly (each few minutes to an hour). The following is a non-exhaustive list of API providers:\nMulti-country providers\nWatttime Electricitymaps Country specific providers\nOfficial Carbon Intensity API for Great Britain France API Data RTE Carbon awareness Being carbon aware means responding to shifts in carbon intensity by increasing or decreasing your demand. The workload should be flexible with when and where you run it to shift accordingly - consuming electricity when the carbon intensity is lower and pausing production when it is higher. Learn more about carbon awareness.\nTip Leverage carbon intensity as followed to allow for carbon awareness:\nUse current emissions for carbon intensity in a given region, to implement demand shaping in your applications and adapt to current emissions and reduce usage / demand when carbon intensity is high. Use forecast emissions for carbon intensity in a given region, to implement time shifting in your applications and time schedule batch workloads when carbon intensity is low. Use average historical emissions for carbon intensity in multiple regions, to implement region shifting at a platform level and deploy workloads to the region with low average carbon intensity. Additionally, use the following non-exhaustive enablers to help you include carbon awareness in your design:\nCarbon Aware SDK\nThe Carbon Aware SDK is a wrapper for Carbon Intensity API providers, used as a WebApi and Command Line Interface (CLI) to assist in building carbon aware software. This is an open source project from The Green Software Foundation. Learn more about the Carbon Aware SDK.\nTime shifting APIs\nUsing electricity when the carbon intensity is low is the best way to ensure investment flows towards low-carbon emitting plants and away from high-carbon emitting plants.\nCheck out this demo API which is built on ElectricityMap and calculates the best time to schedule a job, given the job duration and deadline constraints. For specific services, check out the following.\nAzure Kubernetes Service:\nTime schedule on-demand (or ad-hoc) jobs when carbon intensity is low, given job duration and deadline Time schedule CronJobs (recurrent jobs), when carbon intensity is low, given job duration and deadline GitHub\nTime schedule DevOps workflows when carbon intensity is low, given workflow duration and deadline Info Read about how Microsoft is tyring to make Windows 11 more sustainable by running Windows updates when the carbon intensity is lower for example.\nDemand shaping APIs\nDemand shaping APIs are specific to the following Azure workloads:\nAzure Kubernetes Service\nSuspend jobs when carbon intensity is higher than a given threshold and resume when it’s lower Scale down workloads when carbon intensity is higher than a given threshold and scale up when it’s lower Azure Durable Functions\nSuspend orchestration workflow when carbon intensity is higher than a given threshold and resume when lower Region shifting feature\nSpatial or region shifting means moving your compute to another physical location where the current carbon intensity is lower. It might be a region that naturally has lower carbon sources of energy.\nLearn how to deploy Kubernetes workloads to an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster hosted in low emissions regions using Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager.\nInfo Additionally, explore other carbon aware projects from the Green Software Community such as:\nSustainable UI - A library for building carbon aware web UIs is based on React More Carbon Hack 22 Projects ",

    "content": "The following critical design principles for sustainability resonate with the Green Software Principles from the Green Software Foundation and extend the quality pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework. This set of competencies is needed to design, build, and run green software on Azure.\nCarbon efficiency Emit the least amount of carbon possible\nCarbon emissions will always occur due to our activities, but we can minimize the amount emitted per unit of work by ensuring that every gram of carbon we emit into the atmosphere brings maximum benefit. Green software must be carbon efficient; it must emit the least amount of carbon possible.\nEnergy efficiency Use the least amount of energy possible\nGreen software practitioners are responsible for the energy their products use and strive to make them as energy efficient as possible. But rather than just building the “greenest” software or the most energy-efficient code, our aim is to consider the end user and figure out how to prevent them from emitting needless emissions.\nCarbon awareness Do more when the electricity is cleaner and do less when the electricity is dirtier\nThe application must be made aware of how much carbon it is emitting. We can utilize different approaches such as demand shifting to move workloads to data centers or periods where this a high energy supply and a low demand that can satisfied by renewable energy and demand shaping to adjust an application’s behavior and appearance in real-time to match the energy supply.\nHardware efficiency Use the least amount of embodied carbon possible\nThe carbon that was released to build a device is known as embodied carbon. You must consider the carbon released when running the computer as well as the carbon incorporated in its production and disposal when determining your overall carbon footprint.\nA sustainable application will therefore ensure that older devices are supported and will increase each device’s efficiency. Because demand shifting and demand shaping may be used, cloud computing is more energy efficient than an on-premises server.\nMeasuring sustainability What you can’t measure, you can’t improve\nCloud applications involve a complex ecosystem, making it difficult to measure their carbon emissions. The whole ecosystem is involved, from the cloud infrastructure (with emissions dashboards to help us), to the network paths that are crossed, to edge technology and user devices.\nThe Software Carbon Intensity is a method of scoring any software application, not limited to just cloud or not just end-user applications, but all types of applications in between. It provides a common language to describe how software behaves with respect to carbon emissions and how a proposed change might eliminate some of them.\nClimate commitments Understand the exact mechanism of reduction\nEvery organization or entity has several options for reducing its carbon footprint. We should, however, stay focused on preventing carbon emissions from the start, a goal that the Green Software Foundation supports. This is what we call Abatement, or Carbon Elimination.\nA company’s strategy can combine all possible methodologies and, depending on the result, can reach a Net Zero target by eliminating carbon emissions where possible, and compensating for residual emissions.\nThe Software Carbon Intensity equation aims to eliminate emissions, which should always be the primary goal of a sustainable workload, and the score can only be reduced with abatement.\n",
