      <description>The consequences of climate change are increasingly apparent, from wildfires to devastating flooding; and the scientific consensus is clear—to avert the worst effects of the rapidly changing climate, the world needs to transition to a net zero carbon emissions economy by 2050.
The solution to the climate crisis involves everyone If you're reading this document and identify as Green, know you're part of a massive global movement of people who care and are taking action. Greens work in every discipline across engineering, from designing silicon to designing user experiences. Nothing happens in isolation, everything is connected, and small changes lead to significant changes. Even the act of normalizing a discussion about sustainability in technical meetings will empower others to raise their voices. That's how you create change in any organization.
As Green Software Practitioners, we believe that everyone has a part to play in the climate solution. Green Software Engineering is inclusive. Whatever sector, industry, role, technology; there is always something you can do to have an impact.
Sustainability is enough, all by itself, to justify our work We recognize there are many advantages to building sustainable applications. They are almost always cheaper, they are often more performant, they are often more resilient. But the primary reason we are practicing Green Software Engineering is for sustainability; everything else is an added advantage.
Should I take this training? Regardless of the application area, industry, organization size, or programming language, this workshop lays out the standards to assist build a shared understanding of what it means to be a green software practitioner.
These recommendations should be studied by anybody involved in building, deploying, or managing software to make choices that significantly reduce the amount of carbon produced by their applications.
At the end of this workshop, you will be able to better leverage architectural guidance, solution options and best practices to build solutions in Azure that meets best practices for sustainability.</description>

      <description>What is a sustainable workload? The word &amp;ldquo;workload&amp;rdquo; refers to a group of application resources that help achieve a shared business objective or carry out a shared business process. Various services, such as APIs and data storage, collaborate to provide a certain end-to-end capability.
We discuss the environmental impact of our tasks when we talk about sustainability.
Therefore, a sustainable workload refers to the process of developing solutions that increase usage while decreasing waste, thereby lowering the environmental impact.</description>
