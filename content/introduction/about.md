The consequences of climate change are increasingly apparent, from wildfires to devastating flooding; and the scientific consensus is clear—to avert the worst effects of the rapidly changing climate, the world needs to transition to a net zero carbon emissions economy by 2050.

In this 3x3 (three hours a day for three days) virtual workshop, you will learn about **building sustainable solutions on Azure** and how they can be designed with compliance, governance, and security practices in mind.

You will work in small groups on a real-life customer scenario that simulates the format of an **Architecture Design Session (ADS)**. You will create and design solutions using Azure as well as bring engagements from the commit to realization phase.

You will apply your skills and knowledge of architectural best practices and design patterns as well as concepts of **Well-Architected Framework (WAF)** to identify and architect expansion opportunities with Azure. Your final solution will include a reference architecture and a deployment plan on how to move the solution into production in the most effective way. 

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to better help customers with architectural guidance, solution options and best practices on building solutions in Azure that also meets best practices for sustainability.

### What to expect
There are many different types of learning programs here at Microsoft including online training, Microsoft Learn, OpenHacks, MCTs, etc.

This is a technical application workshop with a focus on experiential group learning and collaboration with your peers to solve a customer business problem.  You will be strategizing solution considerations like WAF to design a robust recommended solution architecture to meet the customer’s needs.

It is not a hands-on lab or a lecture-based course. The Partner Solution Accelerator Hackathon, MCTs, OpenHacks, etc. are all great follow-on trainings you can consider to continue and extend your learning on this topic afterward.
