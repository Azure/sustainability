**[Carbon Efficiency](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/practitioner/carbon-efficiency)**: Emit the least amount of carbon possible.

A carbon efficient cloud application is one that is optimized, and the starting point is the cost optimization.

**[Energy Efficiency](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/practitioner/energy-efficiency/)**: Use the least amount of energy possible.

One way to increase energy efficiency, is to run the application on as few servers as possible, with the servers running at the highest utilization rate; thereby increasing hardware efficiency as well.

**[Hardware Efficiency](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/practitioner/hardware-efficiency)**: Use the least amount of embodied carbon possible.

There are two main approaches to hardware efficiency:

* For end-user devices, it's extending the lifespan of the hardware.
* For cloud computing, it's increasing the utilization of the resource.

**[Carbon Awareness](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/practitioner/carbon-awareness)**: Do more when the electricity is cleaner and do less when the electricity is dirtier.

Being carbon aware means responding to shifts in carbon intensity by increasing or decreasing your demand.
