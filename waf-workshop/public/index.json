    "content": "The consequences of climate change are increasingly apparent, from wildfires to devastating flooding; and the scientific consensus is clear—to avert the worst effects of the rapidly changing climate, the world needs to transition to a net zero carbon emissions economy by 2050.\nIn this 3x3 (three hours a day for three days) virtual workshop, you will learn about building sustainable solutions on Azure and how they can be designed with compliance, governance, and security practices in mind.\nYou will work in small groups on a real-life customer scenario that simulates the format of an Architecture Design Session (ADS). You will create and design solutions using Azure as well as bring engagements from the commit to realization phase.\nYou will apply your skills and knowledge of architectural best practices and design patterns as well as concepts of Well-Architected Framework (WAF) to identify and architect expansion opportunities with Azure. Your final solution will include a reference architecture and a deployment plan on how to move the solution into production in the most effective way.\nAt the end of this workshop, you will be able to better help customers with architectural guidance, solution options and best practices on building solutions in Azure that also meets best practices for sustainability.\nWhat to expect There are many different types of learning programs here at Microsoft including online training, Microsoft Learn, OpenHacks, MCTs, etc.\nThis is a technical application workshop with a focus on experiential group learning and collaboration with your peers to solve a customer business problem. You will be strategizing solution considerations like WAF to design a robust recommended solution architecture to meet the customer’s needs.\nIt is not a hands-on lab or a lecture-based course. The Partner Solution Accelerator Hackathon, MCTs, OpenHacks, etc. are all great follow-on trainings you can consider to continue and extend your learning on this topic afterward.\n",

What is the difference between Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and Well Architected Framework (WAF)? What are the five pillars of Microsoft Azure Well-Architected framework? How does WAF contribute to a solution’s overall sustainability profile? As a team, perform an assessment of the team’s proposed solution architecture from Step 2 using the WAF assessment questions. Discuss the following questions: Are there any additional questions that should be part of the assessment, especially when it comes to building sustainable practices? Does the team solution follow best practices and patterns? How do we confirm this? Build the following slides for the final presentation (Step 4). Confirmation that the proposed solution is following best practices and patterns for sustainability and other measures. Description of how this confirmation is done.

Resolve the changes across the architecture landscape: what will be removed, retired and/or maintained. Tip You can use PowerPoint or any other tool: Visio, Draw.io, LucidChart or Cacoo.\nDiscussion questions What tools are available to help measure the emissions of existing on-premises environments? How can emissions be measured in Azure? As solution designers and engineers, what do you have control over when it comes to sustainability in Azure? How does that contrast to that which Microsoft can control? What tradeoffs are required to support sustainability goals while meeting business requirements? How should you pick a suitable region to deploy to? Consider network access patterns. What VM SKUs are available to support your workload? Do these translate to energy efficiency improvements? Are more appropriate services that match your workloads profile available? What scaling patterns should you implement? What tools are available to identify underutilized, redundant and non-critical capacity? How can you manage updates and patching across all of your Azure services? What are the benefits of doing so from a sustainability angle? What changes can you make to optimize your applications to minimize resource usage, beyond their overall architecture? ",

Use the table after the case study to make any relevant notes. Build one or two slides in preparation for the final presentation (Step 4) including the following: Customer case study key points. Main characteristics of the current customer environment. Note The focus of this step is becoming familiar with customer case study, while Step 2 is dedicated to solution architecture.\nCase study Contoso is a highly respected business leadership academy based in London, United Kingdom with more than 150,000 members in the region and another 2,500,000 worldwide. They deliver in-person training, online seminars and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).\nAmong their various cohorts there is alignment between their curriculum and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as with the UK’s Net Zero Strategy which sets our policies and proposals for decarbonizing all sectors of the UK economy to meet their net zero target by 2050.\nFurthermore, Contoso’s corporate and social responsibility (CSR) “3D strategy” defines the following key goals:\nDeeply care about their staff, their academia and their partners to build and nurture fruitful collaboration while delivering the best results. Develop best-of-breed leaders to tackle key challenges of today while mitigating the ones of tomorrow. Deploy the most sustainable, securely trusted and innovative solutions to drive benefits for their academia and also across society. Currently, the academy runs IT workloads in an on-premises datacenter where it has invested in and completed an IT modernization project approximately 2 years ago. As a result, their board has been very reluctant to adopt new cloud technologies not only due to budget constraints but also because of the reduced amount of staff dedicated to manage their environments.\nThat said, the academy was unfortunately targeted by a cybersecurity attack which compromised over 275,000 user accounts among their academia and staff compromising the access to their main MOOC portal for over two weeks. Such infrastructure was predominantly reliant on virtual machines running a frontend web-farm connected to a SQL highly-available backend system. The backend not only hosts a whole raft of material (including 70TB of video content) accounting for approximately 90% of all of their storage but is also very costly and reaching end-of-life in 14 months. The incident took a lot longer to resolve due to the lack of advanced security technology and rudimentary incident response mechanisms.\nWhen attending COP27, Contoso’s CTO met with a Microsoft representative to discuss the potential benefits of adopting Microsoft Azure in alignment with their 3D strategy to help with reducing their carbon footprint and drive adoption of advanced cloud-native services for their MOOC platform. This would allow a pivot towards other innovative use cases leveraging their pool of data through the adoption of services such as Azure Cognitive Search and Azure Video Analyzer for Media.\nAs a result, Contoso now aims to retire as much of their datacenter footprint to allow them to:\nIncrease the security posture across their infrastructure. Reduce the administrative burden on their teams by leveraging platform-as-a-service or other cloud-native services where possible. Reduce and optimize their carbon footprint as a result of adopting Microsoft Azure. For a start and based upon the above, their plan is to migrate their MOOC platform into Azure – that is the scope of this exercise.\n",
