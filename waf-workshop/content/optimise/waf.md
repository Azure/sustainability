##### Directions
- Discuss the following questions:
    1. What does well-architected mean at Microsoft?
    2. What is the difference between Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and Well Architected Framework (WAF)?
    3. What are the five pillars of Microsoft Azure Well-Architected framework?
    4. How does WAF contribute to a solution’s overall sustainability profile? 
- As a team, perform an assessment of the team’s proposed solution architecture from Step 2 using the WAF assessment questions.
- Discuss the following questions:
    1. Are there any additional questions that should be part of the assessment, especially when it comes to building sustainable practices? 
    2. Does the team solution follow best practices and patterns? 
    3. How do we confirm this? 
- Build the following slides for the final presentation (Step 4).
    - Confirmation that the proposed solution is following best practices and patterns for sustainability and other measures.
    - Description of how this confirmation is done.
    - Summary of the design methodology that your solution will implement to measure, track, and optimise energy usage and emissions over time.

##### WAF assessment questions
###### Sustainability
{{% notice style="tip" %}}
Consider running through the well-architected [sustainability workload assessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&id=a24b1079-29a4-4d22-b678-376e84884f76&session=3e0a9280-3575-4b5d-9fd6-9d0c3b9a16ee) to help with this section.

2. How does sustainability overlap with the core pillars of the Well-Architected Framework?
3. How can the hosted application itself be designed for sustainability?
4. What platform decisions can you make to reduce the emissions profile of the workload?
5. What tools can be used to track the ongoing carbon impact? Are there policies and processes that can be put in place by the organisation to keep them in check?

###### Cost optimization
1. What Azure tool can you use to estimate the overall costs of your solutions?
2. What Azure tool can you use to identify opportunities to reduce overall cost?
3. How does billing work in Azure?
4. What additional cost should you take into consideration?
5. What can the overall cost of your solutions tell you about how sustainable it is?

###### Operational excellence
1. What is Infrastructure as Code?
2. How can Azure help increase your operational excellence and enhance your practices?
3. What checks can you put in place to ensure your solution does not use unnecessary resources thus increasing its negative environmental impact?
