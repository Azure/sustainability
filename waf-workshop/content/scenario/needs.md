##### Directions
Your customer provides a list of their needs. The team has a solution-focused discussion about this new information.
- Discuss solutions for the customer needs using your notes and considering the following questions:
    - Are there any additional needs that arenâ€™t explicitly provided by the customer?
    - What can we infer?
    - How could we address these needs?
- Build a slide with solutions to customer needs for the final presentation (Step 4).
