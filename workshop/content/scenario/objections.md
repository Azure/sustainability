##### Directions
You’ve been provided a consolidated list of customer’s objections that were collected throughout the discovery process. 
- Discuss each customer objection and determine possible responses.
- Build a slide with responses to customer objections for the final presentation (Step 4). 

##### Objections
1. How can we analyze whether this project will reduce our carbon emissions?
2. Any reason for us to consider PaaS over moving the application as-is to IaaS?
3. Have we considered alternative architectures for the application? Why have you chosen the proposed architecture?
4. How can the operations team efficiently manage and monitor the new platform? What tools and training are needed? 
5. If the primary region fails, how can we ensure business continuity while keeping sustainability in mind?
6. How can we keep track of the impact of future development into our carbon emissions footprint?
7. We would like to ensure lowest latency for the end users of the service.
8. How could you monitor the emissions generated by this solution and set goals to track your progress towards carbon reduction targets?
