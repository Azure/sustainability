##### Directions
- Use the discussion questions to guide your architecture. 
- As a team, build a diagram illustrating how the customerâ€™s existing structure can be made sustainable using sustainable best practices.

Requirements:
- Include all the elements from Step 1 to build your solution.
- Include candidate roadmap components and explain which will be introduced to the current architectural landscape.
- Resolve the changes across the architecture landscape: what will be removed, retired and/or maintained.

##### Discussion questions
1. What tools are available to help measure the emissions of existing on-premises environments? How can emissions be measured in Azure?
2. As solution designers and engineers, what do you have control over when it comes to sustainability in Azure? How does that contrast to that which Microsoft can control?
3. What tradeoffs are required to support sustainability goals while meeting business requirements?
4. How should you pick a suitable region to deploy to? Consider network access patterns.
5. What VM SKUs are available to support your workload? Do these translate to energy efficiency improvements? Are more appropriate services that match your workloads profile available?
6. What scaling patterns should you implement? What tools are available to identify underutilized, redundant and non-critical capacity?
7. How can you manage updates and patching across all of your Azure services? What are the benefits of doing so from a sustainability angle?
8. What changes can you make to optimize your applications to minimize resource usage, beyond their overall architecture?
